  <h2>The Struggle of Sebastian</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>This program was created in scratch. The purpose of my program is to have 
    the user play a simple choose-your-own adventure game in which they follow 
    the story of a highschool student and choose multiple decisions which affect 
    how the student does on an upcoming test. In the process of creating this game
    my partner and I ran into many difficulties, all of which we eventually overcame
    through trial and error. Most of the problems came from the way we coded it as it
    caused parts of the code to overlap itself. With some minor changes to the code
    we were able to get our project to work as intended. As this is the first project 
    I have completed, it is not the best compared to others, but it was an important 
    first step in my learning in this class.</p>

 <h2>Choose That Pokemon</h2>

 <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The programming language used in the video is appInventor. My program is an app that aims
    to help people choose a pokemon starter if they are unsure of which one they want to pick. 
    Using the methods acquired from my first project, creating this program was fairly easy,
    it was a lot of trial and error and trying to figure out how my partners and I wanted to 
    format it. Compared to my first program, this one ran much smoother and was more
    organized. This project also gave me experience with working with multiple partners and
    how each person has their own way to contribute to the project.

  <h2>Interactive Fiction</h2>

  </video>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The progamming language used in the video is Python version 2.7.1. This program is a choose
    your own adventure game where your inputs into the console affect the course of the story. Creating 
    this program was much different as instead of using a block-based programming language like Scratch 
    or AppInventor, my partners and I had to write this from scratch. This program gave me valuable experience
    with the different types of functions on and allowed me to familiarize myself with how the coding on
    Python works. As this was the first time me or my partners had ever used Python, the coding process took
    longer than expected, but in the end we were able to create a fully functioning program.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Restaurant Helper</h2>

  </video>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The program was written on repl.it with Python version 2.7.1. The purpose of this program 
    is to calculate the tax and tip of a meal at a restaurant. Creating this program was much
    easier as I already had previous experience from the Interactive Fiction prject. Though
    througout this experience I got more exposure to the functions of python and was able to 
    expand my knowlegde on creating code from scratch. The coding process on this project was
    much smoother and faster as my partner and I already knew how coding on Python worked.

  <h2>Investigate With Data</h2>
  <img src="Images/BigData.JPG" alt="Picture of a graph from the project." controls width="1000" height="500">
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The focus of this project was to take a large set of data and be able to analyze it by creating
    data tables and drawing connections from those tables. This project helped me to expand my analysis
    skills and find useful information from a large set of data found on online repositories. This project
    was also extremely interesting as we could do it on whatever topic we wanted.
    </p>

  <h2>Simulation Modification</h2>

  </video>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>This project was done on NetLogo. The purpose of this project was to take and already existing
    simulation and make a modification to that simulation in order to see how those new factors affect
    it. Creating this modification turned out to be relatively difficult as the language that NetLogo
    uses is completely different from anything we had experienced prior. Once we familiarized ourselves
    with how the language worked, creating the modification proved to be easy. As a result, my partner
    and I were able to make a significant modifiation to the original simulation which allowed us to
    see how that created changes.

  <h2>Malware Presentation</h2>
  <img src="Images/Formjacking.jpg" alt="Picture of the Malware Presentation on Formjacking." conrtols width="1000" height="500">
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The purpose of this presentation was to research a known malware or cyber security concern. My presentation
    was on Formjacking a relatively new type of malware. From this presentation and others presentations I learned about
    many different types of malware, which raised my awareness to be more careful online when inputting and using
    personal information.</p>

  <h2>Create Performance Task</h2>

  </video>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p> This is my Create Performance Task for the 2019 AP Computer Science Principles test. The program was created in scratch and
    is intended to be a game where you avoid obstacles that move around the screen. This project was the culmination of everything
    that I learned throughout the year. To create this game I used every skill and piece of knowledge that I gained from previous
    projects. I am quite proud of the result as it is a fully functional game that I created solely on my own without any guidance.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Explore Performance Task</h2>
  <img src="Images/ExploreTask.jpg" alt="Picture of the artifact from the project." conrtols width="1000" height="500">
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>This is my Explore Performance Task for the 2019 AP Computer Science Principles test. The purpose of this performance task is to
    use critical thinking to explain the purpose and rammifications of an innovation of your choice. My performance task was on self-flying
    planes which are, as the name implies, planes that can fly without the need of a human. This project was similar to our Computational 
    Innovation project that we did earlier in the year. While I did not do very well on that presentation, I was able to use the feedback 
    that I recieved to make improvements and create a better performance task overall.</p>

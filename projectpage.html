    <p>My program was created in scratch. The purpose of my program is to have 
    the user play a simple choose-your-own adventure game in which they follow 
    the story of a highschool student and choose multiple decisions to affect 
    how the student does on an upcoming test. There are three different endings 
    to the game which the player can reach by making their decisions. Depending 
    on the users choices the student can either fail, do just as well as he did 
    previously, or pass the test. The video illustrates how the game is played, 
    including controls, the way the dialogue is displayed, and a short background 
    of who the user is playing as. It also shows off one of the three endings that 
    the player can reach and the decisions the player can make in order to achieve 
    that ending.</p>

    There were multiple issues that both me and my partner ran into while
    creating this game. One of the problems was the ability to progress back 
    and forth through the dialogue. We wanted the player to be able to change 
    their decision, in case they made a mistake in choosing it however, it only 
    created problems for us. The way we did the dialogue was a simple accumulator 
    value and once that value reached a certain number, it would display the dialogue, 
    Because we had multiple decisions that could be made, there was a small overlap in 
    the accumulator values so that if the player decided to go back in the dialogue it 
    would cause an issue where it might go back to earlier in the story or switch to an 
    entirely different outcome. To fix this I had to set the accumulator values to a much 
    higher number for each decision to ensure that there would be no overlapping in the 
    code. We also found a problem in resetting the sprites once the backgrounds changed 
    back and forth. In the game there were multiple sprites used to tell the story and 
    once the story progressed those sprites would get in the way, especially if the player 
    were to go back to a previous screen. I had to duplicate some of the backgrounds and set 
    them to their own independent values in order to get the proper sprites to display at the 
    correct times.</p>

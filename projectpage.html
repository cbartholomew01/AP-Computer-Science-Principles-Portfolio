  <h2>Scratch Project: The Struggle of Sebastian</h2>

    <p>My program was created in scratch. The purpose of my program is to have 
    the user play a simple choose-your-own adventure game in which they follow 
    the story of a highschool student and choose multiple decisions to affect 
    how the student does on an upcoming test. There are three different endings 
    to the game which the player can reach by making their decisions. Depending 
    on the users choices the student can either fail, do just as well as he did 
    previously, or pass the test. The video illustrates how the game is played, 
    including controls, the way the dialogue is displayed, and a short background 
    of who the user is playing as. It also shows off one of the three endings that 
    the player can reach and the decisions the player can make in order to achieve 
    that ending.</p>
    </li>

    There were multiple issues that both me and my partner ran into while
    creating this game. One of the problems was the ability to progress back 
    and forth through the dialogue. We wanted the player to be able to change 
    their decision, in case they made a mistake in choosing it however, it only 
    created problems for us. The way we did the dialogue was a simple accumulator 
    value and once that value reached a certain number, it would display the dialogue, 
    Because we had multiple decisions that could be made, there was a small overlap in 
    the accumulator values so that if the player decided to go back in the dialogue it 
    would cause an issue where it might go back to earlier in the story or switch to an 
    entirely different outcome. To fix this I had to set the accumulator values to a much 
    higher number for each decision to ensure that there would be no overlapping in the 
    code. We also found a problem in resetting the sprites once the backgrounds changed 
    back and forth. In the game there were multiple sprites used to tell the story and 
    once the story progressed those sprites would get in the way, especially if the player 
    were to go back to a previous screen. I had to duplicate some of the backgrounds and set 
    them to their own independent values in order to get the proper sprites to display at the 
    correct times.</p>

 <h2>AppInventor Project: Choose That Pokemon</h2>

    <p>The programming language used in the video is appInventor. My program is an app that aims
    to help people choose a pokemon starter if they are unsure of which one they want to pick. 
    The video shows the two main screens of the app, the intro screen and the main menu. From 
    the main menu, the user can choose from seven different generations of pokemon. Once a 
    generation is chosen it changes to another screen where the player can choose from three 
    different pokemon: pokemon 1, pokemon 2, and pokemon 3. Depending on what generation they 
    chose, it will show a picture and provide information on the pokemon specific to that 
    generation. In the video generation 1 is picked and all of the pokemon, bulbasaur, 
    charmander, and squirtle are shown. The information varies from each of the pokemon, 
    and it states which pokemon would be good for beginning players, all in an effort to 
    help the user choose which starter they want.

    <p>Our program was relatively easy to create. Once we had the idea in mind, we were able 
    to execute it fairly well. The most difficult parts of making the program that we faced 
    were deciding if we should throw all of the pokemon onto one screen, and making the format 
    for the information that would be shown for the pokemon. We decided that each generation 
    would have its own separate screen to reduce clutter on the main screen and made the code 
    a little easier to deal with. The user feedback that we received was quite limited as there 
    was really no trouble in creating the code. The program worked well and did what we intended 
    for it to do, we did get some feedback on the layout of the screens which helped us to better 
    display the information so the user could read it easier. We intended for the program to use 
    a scroll layout, which we had some trouble in creating, so the user could scroll through the 
    information. After testing it out for a bit we got it to work but in the end never ended up 
    using the scroll arrangement as there was not enough information to take up the entirety of 
    the screen.

  <h2>Python Project: Restaurant Helper</h2>

  </video>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The program was written on repl.it with Python version 2.7.1. The purpose of this program 
    is to provide assistance to people who go out to eat at restaurants. The video illustrates the 
    code of the program and various inputs one can put in. This program easily calculates the tax 
    on meals, how much you would spend on tip, and what the price would be if you split the bill.
    The video also illustrates what happens when the user inputs anything other than a number or 
    loat. If the user were to input “a” or any other letter, the program would provide an error 
    message and prompt the user to input something else.</p></li>
    <li><p>For the beginning of the program we had to code the amount of tax that is spent on the meal 
    first. We had small issues with getting the math elements to work as we were combining strings 
    with integers and floats. To fix this all we had to do was define all variables as floats, do 
    the math, then define those floats as strings so that we could print the outputs. After the tax 
    calculator, we added the tip amount and after that we added the people it was split by. Initially 
    we had all of the code in one big chunk, but as we were running it we discovered that we needed 
    to program a way to detect whether or not the input was a number. This was the part of the code 
    we had the most trouble with. At first we tried to create multiple while loops to run the code 
    through but when testing it, the code would just loop through that first while loop. Instead of 
    creating multiple while loops, we decided to split the code up into two separate parts. We defined 
    a new function aside from the main code that was specifically created to check the input. Creating 
    the function was simple however, implementing the function into the main code proved to be a challenge. 
    When running the code we would get an error message saying that it cannot concatenate non-type elements 
    with our other float values, so we needed to figure out a way to add a float type to the input. To fix 
    this we added a argument to the var() function, which was the input checker, which would be the prompt 
    that asked the user to input something in, and we later defined that argument as a float. Now, when 
    running it, it accepted the input and all we had to do after that was create and except statement that 
    gave and error if anything other than a number was put in.</p>

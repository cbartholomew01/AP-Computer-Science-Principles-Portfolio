    <p>Hello, my name is Connor Bartholomew. I am finishing my senior year at Don Antonio Lugo Highschool.
    I decided to take this class because I was interested in learning how programs were created and how things
    on the internet function. This website was created to keep track of my progress throughout the year, and 
    for me to continue to make improvements to my skills at programming. Now, at the end of the year, I feel 
    that my skills have improved immensly since the beginning of the year and feel ready to move on to more 
    intensive classes dealing with computer science.
    </p>

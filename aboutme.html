    <p>Hello, my name is Connor Bartholomew. I am currently a senior at Don Antonio Lugo Highschool. I created this webpage for my AP
    Computer Science Principles class. I wanted to take this class because I am interested in learning about how to code and create my
    own programs in a varitey of different programming languages.</p>

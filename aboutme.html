    <p>Hello, my name is Connor Bartholomew. I am currently a senior at Don Antonio Lugo Highschool.
    I decided to take this class because I am interested in learning how programs work and how everything
    on the internet functions. So far, I have already learned a lot and want to learn more. This website
    was created to keep track of my progress throughout the year, and for me to continue to make improvements
    to my skills at programming.</p>
